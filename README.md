## Alexander Imm

I am a curious and enthusiastic Software Developer in training, who loves solving problems and learning new technologies. I chose not to go to university and instead decided to focus on something in which I have both a genuine interest and could develop into a career. I am looking for the opportunity to work as part of a skilled team working on large scale complex problems.

## Skills

#### Fast learner

I am confident in my ability to pick up new technologies quickly and apply the knowledge effectively. A good example of this being my practice project at Makers Academy where my group and I built a Google chrome extension.

- Tight deadline of less than 4 Days
- First time using React, Node.js and Webpack
- New to Mocha, Chai and Enzyme - used for testing
- Completed the project on time

#### Team player

I'm confident in working on my own but I also greatly appreciate the value of working as part of a team. During my final project at Makers Academy, my group and I decided to build a maths quiz skill for the amazon echo.

- Maintained a common headspace via regular stand-ups and retros
- Split off into pairs when appropriate to maximise efficiency
- Communicated ideas effectively
- Worked well as a team because of constant feedback

#### Problem solver

My ability to convert seemingly big challenges into smaller tasks that are well defined and achievable has greatly improved my organisation and efficiency when working on projects at Makers Academy. When handling smaller problems, such as errors and bugs, I aim to employ the best possible debugging processes to fix problems as quickly as possible.
