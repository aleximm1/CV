## Alexander Imm

I am a curious and enthusiastic Software Developer in training, who loves solving problems and I enjoy learning new technologies. I chose not to go to university and to instead focus on something in which both I have a genuine interest and could see myself doing for the rest of my life.
A sentence about who and what you are. Then a sentence about what you've achieved. And then a sentence about what you're looking for: what you would ideally be doing, with whom and in what environment.

## Skills

#### Leadership

I feel confident in my ability to lead small teams from my time in the Army cadets.

Another Skill

Descriptive paragraph of how capable you are at this skill and, if relevant, how it has developed.

A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)

#### Team player

I'm confident in working on my own but I also greatly appreciate the value of working as part of a team. During my practice project week at Makers Academy, my group and I decided to build a chat room Google chrome extension in React.

Maintained a common headspace via regular stand-ups and retros
Split off into pairs when appropriate to maximise efficiency
Communicated ideas effectively
Worked well as a team because of constant feedback
Completed the project on time

#### Attention to detail

For my final project at Makers Academy, I took part in building an Alexa skill for the Amazon Echo. Being a completely new technology with a lack of extensive documentation, we faced some struggles along the way.

Faced a problem with Alexa’s pronunciation of certain phrases and words
Had to manipulate Alexa's speech output through the use of SSML
Saw the consequences of the smallest change
It was a success as Alexa ended up saying things the way we wanted
