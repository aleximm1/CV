#### Team player

I'm confident in working on my own but I also greatly appreciate the value of working as part of a team. During my practice project week at MA, my group and I decided to build a chat room Google chrome extension in JavaScript.

Maintained a common headspace via regular stand-ups and retros
Split off into pairs when appropriate to maximise efficiency
Communicated ideas effectively
Worked well as a team because of constant feedback
Completed the project on time

#### Attention to detail

For my final project at MA, I took part in building an Alexa skill for the Amazon Echo. Being a completely new technology with a lack of extensive documentation, we faced some struggles along the way.

Faced a problem with Alexaâ€™s pronunciation of certain phrases and words
Had to manipulate Alexa's speech output through the use of SSML
Saw the consequences of the smallest change
It was a success as Alexa ended up saying things the way we wanted
