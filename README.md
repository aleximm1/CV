## Alexander Imm

I am a curious and enthusiastic Software Developer in training, who loves solving problems and I enjoy learning new technologies. I chose not to go to university and to instead focus on something in which both I have a genuine interest and could see myself doing for the rest of my life. I am looking for the opportunity to work as part of a skilled team working on large scale complex problems.

## Skills

#### Fast learner

I feel am confident in my ability to pick up new technologies in a short amount of time

#### Problem solver



#### Team player

I'm confident in working on my own but I also greatly appreciate the value of working as part of a team. During my final project at Makers Academy, my group and I decided to build a maths quiz skill for the amazon echo.

- Maintained a common headspace via regular stand-ups and retros
- Split off into pairs when appropriate to maximise efficiency
- Communicated ideas effectively
- Worked well as a team because of constant feedback
- Completed the project on time
